The scipt 'pde_solver' was developed mainly to sovlve the time-dependent schroedinger equation in 1 and 2 dimensions,
but it is generalized to solve most linear partial differential equations, using the method Crank-Nicolson.
The script 'ode_solver' solves systems of first order ordinary differential equations, or higher order differential equations.
